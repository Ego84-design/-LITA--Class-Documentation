# LITA_CLASS_DOCUMENTATION             
# This is the documentation the lectures I had with The Incubator on Data Analysis.   

# Project Title:
Data Analysis and procedures.

# Project overview:
The aim of this project is to showcase a detailed description of Data Analysis which includes data entry, data cleaning, structuring, analysing and visualization.

# Data sources: 
The primary sources of data are LITA Incubator Hub and Data sales CSV which is an open source of data collection that can be downloaded from an open source online e.g kaggle or FRED or any other repository site.

# Tools used: 
- Microsoft Excel.
- SQL - Structured Query Language.
- GitHub
- Power BI 
# A. Microsoft Excel:
 This can be used for: a. Data entry and cleaning. b. For Data Analysis. 
c. For visualization. 
We were able yo use MS Excel to carry out the following functions: 
1. Data entry which could be gotten from the front end by typing manually or uploaded.
2. Data cleaning during which phase we did the following: a. data loading and inspection. b. Handling missing variables. 3. Data cleaning and formatting.
d. Formatting and data validation.
e. Formula and functions e.g
i. SUMIFS for confitional sums.
ii. VLOOKUP for data retrieval.
iii.TEXT extraction using LEFT, MID and RIGHT.
iv. Eliminating space using TRIM.
iv. Converting cases using LOWER, UPPER and PROPER.
vi. Pivot table was used for data visualization and report.
# B.SQL - Structured Query Language 
for querying of data. Under SQL we included basic lines of codes or queries and some of the DAX expressions used for analysis e g i. SELECT statement for data retrieval. ii.WHERE and HAVING for filtering. iii.FORM and JOIN clauses for data combination 
iv. GROUP BY and ORDER BY for data aggregation. e g of SQL command includes: SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT, CREATE, ALTER, DROP CASE WHEN, TRUNCATE,etc.
SQL can be used for the the following: data loading and inspection, handling missing variables, data cleaning and formatting.

- SELECT * FROM TABLE EMPLOYEE WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
# Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involves exploration of the data to answer some questions e.g
- What is the overall trend
- Which products are top sellers
- Which region is performing the most
- What are the products on peak sale 
# C. Power BI:
for data manipulation and visualization. It's a flexible tool for making reports. it's a data visualization and business intelligence tool that converts data from different sources to interactive database and BI reports.
# Sources of data for Power BI
- SQL database
- Azure
- Cloud
- Excel
- Access. etc.
# D. GitHub 
for portfolio building. GitHub is a valuable tool for an analyst to effectively manage and collaborate on their portfolio projects. It's a cloud -based platform for person control and collaboration with potential employers and clients. We were thought the following: 
i. Creating an account with GitHub 
ii.collaboration
iii Creating repository 
Pull request, etc. 
With the knowledge I have got so far, I will be able to improve with my work as a learner and move to the next level.
